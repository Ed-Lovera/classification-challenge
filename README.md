# Email Spam Detection Classification Project

## Overview
This project implements a machine learning solution for email spam detection at
an Internet Service Provider (ISP). The system uses supervised learning to
classify emails as either spam or legitimate (not spam) using two different
classification models: Logistic Regression and Random Forest.

## Project Description
The goal is to develop and compare two machine learning models that can
accurately detect and filter spam emails from customers' inboxes. The project
includes data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation to
determine the most effective approach for spam detection.

## Models Implemented
1. Logistic Regression
   - Linear classification model
   - Provides interpretable results
   - Baseline model for spam detection

2. Random Forest
   - Ensemble learning method
   - Capable of capturing non-linear patterns
   - Potentially higher accuracy for complex patterns

## Execution
Run the `spam_detector.ipynb` script to execute the project.
